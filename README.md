**zkTenant** is an app designed to verify **[2D-Doc](https://ants.gouv.fr/nos-missions/les-solutions-numeriques/2d-doc) documents** to create a housing application without sharing more information than necessary.

## How it works

The app allows you to share proof that you are French and that your income is higher than a certain amount without disclosing any other detail. For this, it uses your tax return document and your French ID, both of which being signed with 2D-Doc.

[2D-Doc](https://ants.gouv.fr/nos-missions/les-solutions-numeriques/2d-doc) is a structured digital signature standard widely used for secure document authentication.

Components:

- **[2D-Doc](https://ants.gouv.fr/nos-missions/les-solutions-numeriques/2d-doc)** barcode for documents, used with:
    - Tax return document
    - Post-2021 French ID card
- **[tdd.nr](https://github.com/teddav/tdd.nr)** (based on [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/)): ensuring efficient and privacy-preserving computations.
